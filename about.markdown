# About me

I am a backend developer with proficiency in **Java, Go, C++,** and **Python**. I am passionate about open source and have actively contributed to the community by writing a significant amount of code on GitHub. I have made a total of **300+** commits last year and maintain **32** repositories.

Additionally, I am fascinated by **AI** and **LLMs**. I've been experimenting with building exciting applications based on various APIs.

Beyond coding, I enjoy a variety of activities. I'm a big fan of mystery and science fiction novels and movies, and I love exploring different styles of music. I also enjoy watching anime and playing games, particularly rogue-like, 4X, and strategy games. Recently, I've taken up photography and fitness, which have become my new favorite hobbies.
